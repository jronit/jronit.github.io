        <em> Computer Science, 2027</em>

        <p> My name is Ronit Jain, a freshman studying computer science. 
            I am from the Bay Area and eager to learn and explore all that
            computer science and particularly web development have to offer. 
            Additionally, I love playing sports such as soccer and basketball
            as well as hanging out with friends and traveling. 
        </p>

        <h3> My favorite three places to eat at Berkeley are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Noodle Dynasty</li>
            <li>Curry Pizza House</li>
            <li> Ippudo</li>
        </ul>

            <h4> Part 2: Reading Responses: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Something I learned from this article is that there are a lot of nuances behind every feature and aspect of a particular design. 
                    with each button, text, stamp, etc there is some intention behind it. I found it particularly interesting how you could 
                    truly see these features when the page was deconstructed.
                </li>
                <li> My favorite part of this article was the gifs of deconstructed apps. The graphic really allowed me to see how each page 
                    was organized and developed and the purpose behind particular characteristics of the page. </li>
                <li> Quote I found interesting: "Know the rules, so you can break em." </li>
                <li> On a scale from 1-10 I would rate my experience reading this article an 8. </li>
