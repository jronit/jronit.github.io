							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In this article I learned much of the intricacies, nuances and strategies when designing.
								 This involves knowing your audience and understanding what you are trying to convey with your
								 design. Catering your design specific to the audience you want to reach will help you establish
								 your goals and extract what you want out of the design. 
								 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the many examples of designs they had with varied styles.
								One main idea of the article was to look for inspiration, and I belive that 
							simply viewing this article has given me some inspiration to grow off of. All of the text styles, fonts,
						spacings, and colors compel me to think how I would create my own designs.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
