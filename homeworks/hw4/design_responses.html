						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that there are actual
								legal implications for not creating without accessiblity rather 
								than simply rude practice. This article also helped me better understand 
								color accessiblity. This includes the right contrast, styles, and tone to 
								make the page overall nicer and easier to look at.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> May favorite part of the article was the examples they provided of 
								what to do and what not to do. For instance they provided an example of a 
								good display of color contrast as well as an example of bad color contrast.
								This was really useful for me to see real examples of genuine ways to make my pages more accessible.
